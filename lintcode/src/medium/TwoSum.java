 *
 * Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
 *
 * The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target,
 * where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2)
 * are NOT zero-based.
 *
 * Example
 * numbers=[2, 7, 11, 15], target=9
 *
 * return [1, 2]
 *
 * Note
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution
 *
 * Challenge
 * Either of the following solutions are acceptable:
 *
 * O(n) Space, O(nlogn) Time
 * O(n) Space, O(n) Time
 *
